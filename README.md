# Modernity-GTNH

The objective of this resource pack is to update all the textures of GTNH to the style of Minecraft 1.14.4+.

However, due to recent extensive changes and modifications being made to GTNH and its related Gregtech modules, we are not currently updating the textures of GT.

It's still work in progress, and it is expected to be compatible with GTNH version 2.6.0.

## Features

All textures, including UI elements, blocks, and items, will be completely redrawn.
