# Modernity-GTNH

The objective of this resource pack is to update all the textures of GTNH to the style of Minecraft ~~1.14.4+~~ 1.20.1+.

However, due to recent extensive changes and modifications being made to GTNH and its related Gregtech modules. ~~We are not currently updating the textures of GT~~ Currently in production.

It's still work in progress, and it is expected to be compatible with GTNH version ~~2.6.0~~  2.7.1.

## Features

All textures, including UI elements, blocks, and items, will be completely redrawn.
