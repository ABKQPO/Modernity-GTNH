# Modernity-GTNH

The objective of this resource pack is to update all the textures of GTNH to the style of Minecraft ~~1.14.4+~~ 1.20.1+.

However, due to recent extensive changes and modifications being made to GTNH and its related Gregtech modules. ~~We are not currently updating the textures of GT~~ Currently in production.

It's still work in progress, and it is expected to be compatible with GTNH version ~~2.6.0, 2.7.1~~  2.8.0

## Features

All textures, including UI elements, blocks, and items, and effects will be completely redrawn.

## CTM Textures

**When [`MyCTMLib`](https://github.com/ABKQPO/MyCTMLib) is installed, certain blocks will be given connecting textures with themselves and others, massively improving the look of your machines!**

**Download the version of [`MyCTMLib`](https://github.com/ABKQPO/MyCTMLib) that matches your major version!**

> Download 27x for 2.7

> Download 28x for 2.8

~~If you want to use connected textures, please download this mod here [`MyCTMLib`](https://github.com/ABKQPO/MyCTMLib) and place the `MyCTMLib.cfg` file into the `config folder`~~

**Starting from version 1.1.0, there is no need to place the configuration file anymore.  
You only need to install [`MyCTMLib`](https://github.com/ABKQPO/MyCTMLib) and add the resource pack to use connected textures.**  
**Older versions still require adding the configuration file!**

>Older mod is temporarily suspended from updating, but it can still be used.
